# Impacts on Society

**Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level.** The Introduction to Computer Science (Intro to CS) course doesn't require any prior computer science knowledge in order to be successful. Simply an interest in computer science and willingness to learn about ‘the mysteries of computers’. Intro to CS is meant to be a semester-long learning experience to explore interest in computer science as a whole. The overall speed of the course is slowed down with a reduction in content to emphasize letting students learn and explore these fundamental concepts at a pace that works best for them. This course is open to 9th - 12th grades, but will, most likely, draw many 9th graders.  **Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course** In this document I will describe an activity to be used during the first week of class (a time when there is generally quite a bit of shifting and schedule changes) that introduces students to some basics about computer science and how the decisions computer scientists make can impact society. This activity will require research, discussion, and the creation of a wiki page.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

**Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs)** 
1. Define computer science and the role of a computer scientist.
2. Recognize the social impacts (positive/negative, intended/unintended) from an example of a product or process of computer science.
3. Give examples of products or processes of computer science and their social impacts.
4. Analyze the costs and benefits of the social impacts of computer science.
5. Create a wiki page to share the results of your analysis.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
