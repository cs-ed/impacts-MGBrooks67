# Impacts on Society

**Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level.** The Introduction to Computer Science (Intro to CS) course doesn't require any prior computer science knowledge in order to be successful. Simply an interest in computer science and willingness to learn about ‘the mysteries of computers’. Intro to CS is meant to be a semester-long learning experience to explore interest in computer science as a whole. The overall speed of the course is slowed down with a reduction in content to emphasize letting students learn and explore these fundamental concepts at a pace that works best for them. This course is open to 9th - 12th grades, but will, most likely, draw many 9th graders.  **Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course** In this document I will describe an activity to be used during the first week of class (a time when there is generally quite a bit of shifting and schedule changes) that introduces students to some basics about computer science and how the decisions computer scientists make can impact society. This activity will require research, discussion, and the creation of a wiki page.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

**Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs)** 
1. **Define** computer science and the role of a computer scientist.
2. **Recognize** the social impacts (positive/negative, intended/unintended) from an example of a product or process of computer science.
3. **Give examples** of products or processes of computer science and their social impacts.
4. **Analyze** the costs and benefits of the social impacts of computer science.
5. **Create** a wiki page to share the results of your analysis.

### Learning Activities

**Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?**
This introductory lesson/activity will introduce the students to the basics of computer science and establish a habit of considering the social impacts of computer science throughout the semester.
- Working independently at first, students will read and annotate a definition of computer science (from WikiPedia). Working in a small group (3-4) students will decode the definition and create their own (group) working definition for computer science. Working as a class, we will discuss the working definitions and create a group definition of computer science.
- We will watch the film “War Games” as a class. Students will have a movie guide that will pose questions and facilitate a critical watching of the film. 
Students will collect evidence of decisions made by the computer scientists on the movie guide which will be used during a class discussion about how those decisions affected society in the film. The discussion will focus on the positive and negative effects and whether these effects were intended or unintended.
- Building on our observations and discussion, students will brainstorm a list of products or processes used by computer scientists and the impacts these things have on society today.
- Students will select a product or application of computer science from the list to research on their own. Students will publish their findings on a class wiki that will be published to the public. 

The document, and the film will be revisited throughout the course to focus attention on the many ways the computer science we are studying affects the world we live in.


### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
