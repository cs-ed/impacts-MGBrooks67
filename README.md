# Impacts on Society

**Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level.** The Introduction to Computer Science (Intro to CS) course doesn't require any prior computer science knowledge in order to be successful. Simply an interest in computer science and willingness to learn about ‘the mysteries of computers’. Intro to CS is meant to be a semester-long learning experience to explore interest in computer science as a whole. The overall speed of the course is slowed down with a reduction in content to emphasize letting students learn and explore these fundamental concepts at a pace that works best for them. This course is open to 9th - 12th grades, but will, most likely, draw many 9th graders.  

**Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course** In this document I will describe an activity to be used during the first week of class (a time when there is generally quite a bit of shifting and schedule changes) that introduces students to some basics about computer science and how the decisions computer scientists make can impact society. This activity will require research, discussion, and the creation of a wiki page.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

**Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs)** 
1. **Define** computer science and the role of a computer scientist.
2. **Recognize** the social impacts (positive/negative, intended/unintended) from an example of a product or process of computer science.
3. **Give examples** of products or processes of computer science and their social impacts.
4. **Analyze** the costs and benefits of the social impacts of computer science.
5. **Create** a wiki page to share the results of your analysis.

### Learning Activities

**Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?**
This introductory lesson/activity will introduce the students to the basics of computer science and establish a habit of considering the social impacts of computer science throughout the semester.
- Working independently at first, students will read and annotate a definition of computer science (from WikiPedia). Working in a small group (3-4) students will decode the definition and create their own (group) working definition for computer science. Working as a class, we will discuss the working definitions and create a group definition of computer science.
- We will watch the film “War Games” as a class. Students will have a movie guide that will pose questions and facilitate a critical watching of the film. 
Students will collect evidence of decisions made by the computer scientists on the movie guide which will be used during a class discussion about how those decisions affected society in the film. The discussion will focus on the positive and negative effects and whether these effects were intended or unintended.
- Building on our observations and discussion, students will brainstorm a list of products or processes used by computer scientists and the impacts these things have on society today.
- Students will select a product or application of computer science from the list to research on their own. Students will publish their findings on a class wiki that will be published to the public. 

The document, and the film will be revisited throughout the course to focus attention on the many ways the computer science we are studying affects the world we live in.


### Assessment

**Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.**
- Objective 1 - formative assessment - The class discussion and the creation of the class definition of computer science will be used to judge the level of understanding and clarify any confusion.
- Objectives 2 & 3 - Movie guide will be collected and assessed for completion and appropriate observations.
- Objective 5 - Individual pages of the class wiki will be graded on a rubric that will measure depth of research and effective communication of ideas.


### Outcomes

**Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.**

The film offers many opportunities to focus on questions of diversity/equity/inclusion, and the film guide will draw attention to these issues (i.e. The film is set in a Seattle Washington suburb, in 1983. Not much diversity. The computer scientists in the film are all white males, we will explore possible reasons for this situation/portrayal). The list of impacts that students will research for the wiki will include diversity/equity/inclusion to insure that these issues are discussed.


In my experience, much of the meaningful learning that happens in a high school class comes from the exposure of students to ideas that may not make sense now. Watching a movie like this will give us a common foundation to draw from as the class progresses. The chances of students noticing the inequity is pretty slim, but by pointing out examples in this film, we can use these examples to recognize inequalities in other areas we explore.


The long term goals of this class is to introduce students to the study of computer science and give them some exposure to coding. This lesson introduces students to a definition of computer science and its social impacts at the very beginning of the class. By establishing that computers have had impacts on our society from the beginning, and our tendency to apply innovations in computing before considering (seriously) their possible negative implications, we may possibly help future generations of computer scientists more aware of these issues. Not every one of these students will become a computer scientist, so the exposure to these general issues around diversity, equity, and inclusion is going to be good for the students as individuals and our society at large. (By the way, I know how that last part sounds. But I am a high school teacher, and I need to cling on to the optimism and hope that what I do over and over every day will someday have a positive effect. This is how we maintain our sanity. I’m sure it’s much the same for university professors too.)   ;^)
